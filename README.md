# Mission-to-Mars-Documentation
## Name of Sensor Payload:
*MBC* (Micro-Bit Carrier)
## Summary:

## Overview of Process:
the steps I took throughout this process include initially printing out a basic box to see the size and hold it in my hands before having ideas, then writing a few ideas on my brainstorming paper and trying to make all of my ideas work in my box. Once I had an idea of how it would look I made my prototype and once I tried that the first time, I made a few changes to it like raising the bar that holds the battery in place, making the bar in the middle wider, but also I made this bar shorter because it was hanging too high above the microbit, so it was hardly being held in place at all. Once I printed my final product, the connecter part that snaps in failed. This was because the part fell while being printed, so it was messed up and looked funky. I re-printed this part in a different color and it was printed successfully, giving me the final product of the MBC.
